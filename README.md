# Coupon-App-Android
Android mobile application

DEPRECATED

This was a prototype application that used the xzing library to generate coupon barcodes for shoppers to scan at their local grocery stores. It was a concept project. 

Lessons learned
* Point of Sale system scanners are really archiac, unmaintaned, and poorly designed(little extensibility)
* The RFID 2D barcode scanners don't read shiny phone screens well. 
* Stores want to roll their own loyalty program
